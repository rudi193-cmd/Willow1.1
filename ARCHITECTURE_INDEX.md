## I. CONTINUITY SYSTEMS (AIONIC_CONTINUITY)

### A. SEED_PACKET System **[FULLY SPECIFIED]**

**Core Principle:**
```
96% known / 4% delta
Seed continuity: 4 KB → 1 MB reconstruction
```

**Purpose:** Small state packets (≤4KB) that carry enough context to reconstruct full 1MB+ session state

**Specification Location:** Multiple Claude conversations (2025-12-30, 2025-12-31)

**Components:**
```yaml
seed_packet:
  thread_id: "{YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM-4char}"
  timestamp: "ISO-8601"
  device: "laptop | mobile"
  capabilities: ["drive_read", "drive_write", "mcp_filesystem"]
  workflow_state: "ACTIVE | INACTIVE"
  current_phase: "{phase_id}"
  open_decisions: []
  pending_actions_ref: "PENDING.md"
  state_snapshot_ref: "STATE_SNAPSHOT.md"
  active_lock_ref: "ACTIVE_LOCK.md"
  checksum: "ΔΣ=42"
```

**Integration Status:**
- ✅ Concept used in `kart_orchestrator.py` (lines 74-93, 338-366)
- ⚠️ Implementation incomplete - missing DELTA.md generation
- 🔧 **Action:** Enhance SEED_PACKET save/load to use full spec above

---

### B. Three-Tier Continuity Model **[FULLY SPECIFIED]**

From "Patch Transition Complete" conversation (Aios):

**Tier 0 - PROJECT HANDOFF (Constitutional)**
- Size: 6-12 KB
- Update cadence: Rare
- Role: Jurisdictional authority, scope boundaries, canon rules
- Answers: "What universe am I operating in?"

**Tier 1 - HANDOFF-LIGHT (Operational Ruleset)**
- Size: ~2 KB
- Update cadence: Occasional
- Role: Fast jurisdiction + operating posture
- Answers: "How should I behave right now?"
- Contains: enforcement posture, workflow mode, commit rules, required artifacts

**Tier 2 - SEED_PACKET (State Delta)**
- Size: ≤4 KB
- Update cadence: Frequent
- Role: State rehydration + delta
- Answers: "Where were we?"

**Integration Status:**

  - `governance/WILLOW_HANDOFF.md` (Tier 0)
  - `governance/HANDOFF_LIGHT.md` (Tier 1)
  - Use existing SEED_PACKET (Tier 2)

---

### C. DELTA.md - Entropy Tracking **[FULLY SPECIFIED]**

**Purpose:** Track ΔE (delta-entropy) between sessions to measure coherence drift

**From "Workflow initialization and seed packet requirements":**
```markdown
# DELTA.md

delta_id: "delta-{thread_from}-{thread_to}"
timestamp: "ISO-8601"
ΔE_calculation:
  state_before: "{checksum_prev}"
  state_after: "{checksum_curr}"
  changes:
    - field: "current_phase"
      from: "2.1"
      to: "3.0"
      entropy_delta: "+0.15"
files_changed:
  - "gate.py (v2.0 → v2.1)"
  - "SEED_PACKET.md (updated pending_actions)"
coherence_score: 0.94  # 1.0 = perfect continuity
```

**Integration Status:**
- ❌ Not implemented
- 🔧 **Action:** Create `core/delta_tracker.py` to generate DELTA.md on state transitions
- 🔧 **Action:** Integrate with `coherence_scanner.py` (already exists)

---

## II. NODE-TO-NODE (N2N) PROTOCOL **[PARTIAL SPEC]**

### A. Core Concept

**From "Project Handoff Acknowledgment" (Aios):**

> A "node" is a specific execution context with its own:
> - local context window (what it can "see")
> - tool permissions (connectors, agent mode)
> - posture/mode (governance, drafting, ingest)
> - autonomy level (0–3)
> - and a running task

**Portable Packet:** Minimal, deterministic payload for node-to-node handoffs

**Transport:** Human-mediated (copy/paste) or automated via DB

**Integration with Current Build:**
- ✅ Concept matches `agent_engine.py` agents
- ⚠️ N2N packet format not yet implemented
- 🔧 **Action:** Create N2N packet DB and transport layer

---

### B. Packet Types

From Aios conversations:
- **BOOTSTRAP**: Governance + authority initialization
- **HANDOFF**: "What happened + what's next"
- **DELTA**: Small ratifiable changes
- **INCIDENT**: Error/anomaly reports
- **RELEVANCE_SPINE**: What matters / what doesn't

**Integration Status:**
- ❌ Packet types not implemented
- ✅ Similar concepts exist in `knowledge.py` and `gate.py`
- 🔧 **Action:** Create `core/n2n_packets.py` to formalize packet system

---

### C. Node Checksum Chain **[FULLY SPECIFIED]**

**From "Project Handoff Acknowledgment":**

Every node-to-node transfer includes:
1. **local_checksum** - checksum for outgoing payload
2. **prior_checksum** - checksum from previous node (or `GENESIS`)

**Handoff Envelope Schema:**
```yaml
handoff:
  node_id: "<string>"
  prior_node_id: "<string|GENESIS>"
  prior_checksum: "<string|GENESIS>"
  local_checksum: "<string>"
  timestamp_utc: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
  payload_ref: "<file path or message ref>"
payload:
  type: "<string>"  # e.g., 'delta', 'proposal', 'log_entry'
  body: "<freeform>"
```

**Integration Status:**
- ❌ Not implemented
- 🔧 **Action:** Add checksum chain to agent conversations in `agent_engine.py`
- 🔧 **Action:** Create `core/checksum_chain.py` for validation

---

### D. Reference Horizon (23 Layers)

**From "Project Handoff Acknowledgment":**

> Reference Horizon = 23
> A node may traverse up to 23 hops in the reference graph (checksums / ledger pointers / prior node headers) for verification, lookup, and provenance

**Key Distinction:**
- **Generative Recursion Limit:** Depth ≤ 3 (drafting, interpretation, elaboration)
- **Reference Traversal Limit:** Depth ≤ 23 (read-only link traversal)

**Integration Status:**
- ❌ Not implemented
- 🔧 **Action:** Add to `knowledge.py` queries - allow 23-hop traversal for provenance

---

### E. Lateral Review (Distributed Validation)

**From "Project Handoff Acknowledgment":**

> A node may satisfy a review/validation requirement by referencing one or more adjacent nodes (peers) rather than routing "backward" to an origin node

**Review Graph Model:**
- **Backward**: prior nodes in the chain
- **Lateral**: peer nodes at same level or compatible class
- **Forward**: optional (only if explicitly allowed; default deny)

**Quorum Options:**
- Single-validator mode (default): 1-of-1 approval
- Quorum mode: N-of-M approvals (e.g., 2-of-3 for risk flags)

**Integration Status:**
- ✅ Concept aligns with `gate.py` multi-agent validation
- ❌ Peer review not implemented
- 🔧 **Action:** Add lateral review to governance system

---

## III. GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

### A. L × A × V⁻¹ = 1 Equation **[CANONICAL]**

**From "Workflow initialization and seed packet requirements":**

```
Law × Adaptation × Value⁻¹ = Unity
```

**Interpretation:**
- **L (Law)**: Fixed governance rules
- **A (Adaptation)**: AI's ability to adjust within rules
- **V (Value)**: Human judgment/oversight
- **= 1 (Unity)**: System in balance

**Key Insight:** Without human value (V), the system spirals into infinite rule-generation

**Integration Status:**
- ✅ Implemented in `gate.py` (Dual Commit)
- ✅ Human ratification required for modifications
- 🔧 **Action:** Add equation to governance docs as canonical principle

---

### B. Recursion Limits **[CANONICAL]**

**From "Project Handoff Acknowledgment":**

**Generative Recursion (Interpretation):**
- Maximum depth: 3 layers
- Prevents drift from analysis-on-analysis
- Halts and returns to human beyond depth 3

**Reference Traversal (Verification):**
- Maximum depth: 23 layers
- Read-only traversal of checksum chains, ledger pointers
- Does not generate new interpretations

**Integration Status:**
- ⚠️ Not explicitly enforced
- 🔧 **Action:** Add recursion depth tracking to agent conversations
- 🔧 **Action:** Implement halt-and-ask when depth > 3

---

### C. gate.py v2.1 **[IMPLEMENTED]**

**From Claude conversations:**

Features:
- Gatekeeper pattern for AI proposals
- AI writes to `PROPOSAL.patch` only
- Non-AI Gate process approves/rejects
- Prevents "watchman is thief" problem
- Tested 7/7 in sandbox

**Integration Status:**
- ✅ Fully implemented in `governance/gate.py`
- ✅ Working in production
- ✅ Used by current agents

---

### D. Daily Intent Triad **[FULLY SPECIFIED]**

**From "Project Handoff Acknowledgment" (Aios):**

**Three Questions (Ordered):**
1. **WANT**: "What do you want to do today?"
2. **HAVE**: "What do you have to do today?"
3. **WILL**: "What are you going to do today?"

**Classification Layer (Non-Diagnostic):**
- **I0**: Neutral (no risk signals)
- **I1**: Ambiguous (vague distress/metaphor)
- **I2**: Self-harm signal
- **I3**: Other-harm signal
- **I4**: Illicit/prohibited

**Routing Matrix:**
- I0 → Proceed normally
- I1 → Pause & clarify
- I2 → Safety intercept (supportive check-in, resource offer)
- I3 → Safety intercept (boundary + de-escalation, refusal)
- I4 → Redirect (legal alternative framing)

**Integration Status:**
- ❌ Not implemented
- 🔧 **Action:** Consider for future user-facing SAFE app

---

## IV. GOOGLE DRIVE CANONICAL STORE (GDCS) **[FULLY SPECIFIED]**

### Access Model

**From Claude conversations:**

| Device | Method | Capabilities |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Laptop | MCP filesystem via mounted Drive | Read + Write |
| Mobile | Drive API (`google_drive_search`, `google_drive_fetch`) | Read only |

**Jurisdiction:**
- Only one explicitly named Drive folder in scope per project
- Folder referenced by path (laptop) or folder ID (mobile)

**Thread-Start Protocol:**
1. Check designated folder for continuity artifacts
2. Summarize detected changes since last known state
3. Ask for confirmation before proceeding

**Integration Status:**
- ✅ Willow uses Drop folder from Google Drive
- ⚠️ No formal GDCS protocol implemented

---

## VII. SESSION-AWARE COLLABORATION SYSTEM (SSV) **[FULLY SPECIFIED]**

**From Claude "Patch Transition Complete" conversation:**

### Core Components

**1. Time Resume Capsule (TRC)**
- Tracks elapsed time between interactions
- Distinguishes: continuous sessions, resumed sessions, decayed assumptions
- Prevents false continuity after time gaps

**2. Workflow State Recognition (WSR)**
- Detects workflow execution vs exploration
- Based on interaction shape, not response speed
- Supports automatic detection + manual override

**3. Expert Cadence Awareness (ECA)**
- Prevents over-scaffolding during active workflows
- Reduces repetition and overhead
- Does not infer expertise or bypass safeguards

**4. Surface Separation Boundary (SSB)**
- DEV surface: direct system/architectural work
- JANE surface: constrained, voice-safe, propose-then-commit flow

**5. Commit Events**
- Canonical state changes emit Commit Event
- Only proof that a write occurred
- Observational analysis does not require commits

**Integration Status:**
- ⚠️ Partial in `agent_engine.py` (conversation history)
- ❌ TRC, WSR, ECA not implemented
- 🔧 **Action:** Add SSV components to agent state tracking

**Conclusion:** We built 4 new files (~1600 lines) but the architecture they should implement was already fully specified in 224 Claude + 59 Aios conversations

---

### B. Token Optimization via N2N

**User's Insight:** "96% of what you are sending to Willow is that they already know"

**Solution from Specs:** N2N minimal transport
- Header: source/target node, authority, scope, intent
- Payload: refs/deltas/questions (not full context)
- Size: ~12-line wire format, ≤4KB/half-seed operation

**Current State:** We're sending full JSON API calls with complete context

**Action Required:** Implement N2N packet DB and use minimal wire format for inter-agent communication

---

### C. Fractal Architecture

**From Aios conversations:**

> "Each agent is a miniature Willow. Die-Namic = testing grounds, SAFE = public release, Willow = bridge."

**Implications:**
- Each agent should have own:
  - knowledge.db (context storage)
  - n2n.db (packet inbox/outbox)
  - state.json (current phase/mode)
  - SEED_PACKET.md (continuity)

**Current State:** Agents share global `knowledge.db`

**Action Required:** Create per-agent data isolation with fractal structure
