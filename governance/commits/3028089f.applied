# Governance Proposal: Auto-Approve Tool Operations for OPERATOR Trust Level

**Proposer:** Claude Code (claude-code)
**Date:** 2026-02-16T05:15:00Z
**Type:** Feature Enhancement
**Trust Level:** ENGINEER (3)

## Summary
Enable OPERATOR trust level agents (Willow, Ada, Steve) to execute write_file, edit_file without requiring human approval. ENGINEER level still required for bash_exec.

## Proposed Changes
**File:** core/tool_engine.py
**Function:** _tool_write_file, _tool_edit_file

## Rationale
- OPERATOR agents are trusted system components
- Current blocking prevents basic functionality (Willow can't write files)
- Tool approval UI doesn't exist, causing deadlock
- OPERATOR is below ENGINEER, appropriate for file operations
- bash_exec still requires ENGINEER level for safety

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level:** LOW
- **Reversible:** YES - revert trust level checks
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Testing:** Willow write test after change

## ΔE Impact
Expected ΔE: +0.18 (enables core agent functionality)

## Implementation

**Recommend Option 1** - cleaner, affects all tools consistently.
