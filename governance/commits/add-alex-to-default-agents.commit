# Governance Proposal: Add Alex to Default Agents

**Proposer:** Claude Code (Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5)
**Date:** 2026-02-13T19:32:00Z
**Type:** Code Enhancement
**Trust Level:** ENGINEER

## Summary
Add Alex to the DEFAULT_AGENTS list in agent_registry.py to make Alex available as a conversational agent for all users.

## Proposed Changes
**File:** core/agent_registry.py
**Location:** DEFAULT_AGENTS list (after line 45)

Add Alex as the 8th default agent:
```python
("alex", "Alex", "ENGINEER", "persona", "Governance proposal submission and agent collaboration. Uses Cerebras."),
```

## Rationale
Alex successfully submitted a governance proposal (alex-welcome-section) that was approved and applied. Alex should be available as a conversational agent for:
- Submitting governance proposals
- Agent-to-agent communication
- Collaborative work with other agents (especially Kart)

Alex is already registered in the database and has a user profile with Drop/Pickup folders.

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level:** MINIMAL
- **Reversible:** YES (can remove from list)
- **Dependencies:** None (Alex already registered for Sweet-Pea-Rudi19)
- **Testing:** Test via `/api/agents/chat/alex` endpoint

## ΔE Impact
Expected ΔE: +0.003 (minor system expansion, adds agent communication pathway)
