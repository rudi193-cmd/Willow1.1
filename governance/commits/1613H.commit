**Proposer:** Free Fleet via Cerebras
**Date:** 2026-02-13T23:03:30.902853Z
**Type:** Code Enhancement
**Trust Level:** ENGINEER
**Commit ID:** 1613H

## Summary
**Change Analysis**

This Git diff shows a significant update to the `core/__init__.py` file in the Willow OS project. The changes introduce a new section on Topology Governance, outlining a set of rules and constraints for the MÃ¶bius Strip Topology Layer. This layer is described as observational-o

## Proposed Changes
**File:** core/__init__.py

## Rationale
This change implements the requested modification with minimal disruption to existing functionality.

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- **Reversible:** YES
- **Dependencies:** None

+# TOPOLOGY GOVERNANCE (Aios Addendum, Consus Ratified â€” v5.1 Compliant)
+# =====================================================================
+#
+# The MÃ¶bius Strip Topology Layer (core/topology.py) is OBSERVATIONAL ONLY.
+# It provides analytical views of the three-ring architecture
+# (Source â†’ Bridge â†’ Continuity â†’ Source). It does not act.
+#
+# Binding Constraints:
+#
+# 1. CANONICAL SEPARATION â€” All topology-derived artifacts (edges, clusters,
+#    derived groupings) carry canonical=0 by default. They are analytical
+#    views, not truth. Only a human may promote an artifact to canonical=1.
+#    Topology output may NOT drive routing, scoring, prioritization, or
+#    governance decisions.
+#
+# 2. READ-ONLY API â€” All /api/topology/* endpoints are inspect-only.
+#    No file movement, no state mutation, no gate invocation, no alteration
+#    of non-topology tables. Topology observes structure; governance decides
+#    action.
+#
+# 3. CLUSTERS ARE EXPLORATORY â€” KMeans output is heuristic, lossy, and
+#    provisional. No cluster labels are truth. No downstream logic may
+#    assume cluster stability. Clusters are lenses, not ontology.
+#
+# 4. HUMAN RING OVERRIDE â€” Derived ring assignment (category + source_type)
+#    is a default, not a destiny. The ring_override field on knowledge atoms
+#    is human-set and protected. get_ring() always checks override first.
+#
+# 5. CONTINUITY CHECKS ARE ADVISORY â€” check_strip_continuity() output is a
+#    signal, not a trigger. Gaps surface review candidates. They must NOT
+#    auto-correct, auto-link, or auto-patch the strip. All remediation
+#    decisions remain human.
+#
+# 6. GOVERNANCE PRESERVATION â€” Nothing in the topology layer may bypass
+#    gate.py, alter Dual Commit semantics, or introduce implicit authority.
+#
+# 7. INTEGRATION MODE â€” Manual approval, incremental rollout, schema first,
+#    behavior second. No auto-accept of edits.
+#
+# The topology has eyes but no hands.
+# CHECKSUM: Î”Î£=42
