# Skill Evaluation for Willow

## 1. Agent Orchestration Skills
Claude Code's skills in agent orchestration are evaluated based on the following capabilities:

- **Kubernetes Integrations**: Claude Code's skills with /multi-plan, /multi-execute, and /orchestrate demonstrate expertise in managing multi-agent workflows, aligning with our use case of kart_orchestrator.py.
- Notable gaps in Claude Code's skills:
  * Integration with kart_orchestrator.py is not explicitly documented.
  * Support for more advanced scenarios like rolling updates, zero-downtime deploys, or load balancing of agents is not mentioned.

## 2. LLM Infrastructure Skills

- **LiteLLM Provider Support**: Claude Code's skills with LiteLLM include support for over 100 providers, cost tracking, and retry/fallback capabilities, aligning well with our LLM router's requirements.
- Notable gaps in Claude Code's skills:
  * Custom provider support is not explicitly documented.
  * Advanced routing strategies (e.g., multi-provider round-robin or geographic routing) are not mentioned.

## 3. State & Persistence Skills

- **Cloudflare Skills**: Claude Code's skills with cloudflare/durable-objects provide robust state management capabilities, aligning with our needs for state management and SQLite integration.
- Notable gaps in Claude Code's skills:
  * Session management and state persistence across restarts are not explicitly addressed.

## 4. Security & Governance Skills

- **Trail of Bits Skills**: Claude Code's expertise in trail-of-bits security skills, including audit-context-building, differential-review, and likely more, significantly bolsters our governance workflows with gate.py and Dual Commit.

## 5. Background Tasks & Governance Workflows

- **Cloudflare/agents-sdk**: Claude Code's skills with stateful agents and scheduling capabilities from cloudflare/agents-sdk may help improve our governance workflows and provide more robust background task management.

## 6. Recommendations

Based on these evaluations, the top 3 skills to integrate first are:

1. **Cloudflare/agents-sdk** for stateful agents and scheduling capabilities to improve background task management and governance workflows.
2. **LiteLLM**: To leverage Claude Code's expertise in LiteLLM provider support, cost tracking, and retry/fallback capabilities for our LLM routing.
3. **trail-of-bits security skills**: To strengthen our governance workflows, stateful agents, and auditing framework with the audit-context-building and differential-review features.
