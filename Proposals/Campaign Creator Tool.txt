SAFE OS Extension Proposal

Domain: Dungeons & Dragons Campaign Creator Tool


---

Step 1: Domain Viability Check

A Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) campaign ecosystem is highly compatible with SAFE OS principles.

✔ Distributed Community

Dungeon Masters (DMs), players, guest characters

Online and offline groups

Multi-year campaigns across geographic regions


✔ Rich Archive Material

Character sheets

Session notes

Battle maps

Voice recordings

Homebrew rule documents

Discord logs


✔ Timeline Complexity

In-world chronology

Retconned lore

Parallel plotlines

Character arcs spanning years


✔ Defunct / Deceased Entities

Fallen characters

Destroyed kingdoms

Disbanded parties

Retired DMs

Abandoned campaigns


D&D campaigns are inherently about carrying the dead alongside the living — fallen heroes shape future quests. This aligns directly with SAFE OS memorial philosophy.

Conclusion: Domain is highly viable.

Step 2: Domain Configuration Generation

from safe_os import DomainConfig

dnd_campaign_config = DomainConfig(
    domain_name="DungeonsAndDragonsCampaign",

    entity_types=[
        "Character",          # PCs and NPCs
        "Faction",            # guilds, cults, kingdoms
        "Location",           # cities, dungeons, planes
        "Artifact",           # magical items, relics
        "Event",              # battles, betrayals, discoveries
        "Session",            # real-world play sessions
        "RuleVariant",        # house rules, homebrew systems
        "TimelineBranch"      # alternate or retconned histories
    ],

    relationships=[
        "member_of",          # Character → Faction
        "located_in",         # Artifact/Event → Location
        "killed_by",          # Character → Character
        "destroyed",          # Event → Location
        "possesses",          # Character → Artifact
        "allied_with",        # Faction → Faction
        "betrayed",           # Character → Faction
        "retconned_by",       # TimelineBranch → Event
        "originated_in",      # Character → Location
        "appeared_in_session" # Entity → Session
    ],

    hooks=[
        "character death",
        "final session",
        "party disbanded",
        "retcon",
        "new campaign arc",
        "legendary item discovered",
        "TPK",
        "DM retirement"
    ],

    pre_training_sources=[
        "SRD rule documents",
        "Published campaign settings",
        "Fantasy narrative corpora",
        "Community wiki archives",
        "Session recap documents",
        "Actual play transcripts"
    ]
)

Step 3: Cultural Context Engine Rules

Custom Cultural Principle

from safe_os import CulturalPrinciple

heroic_weight_principle = CulturalPrinciple(
    name="HeroicWeightAndAbsurdity",
    description=(
        "Campaigns must preserve both comedic table chaos and the "
        "long emotional arc of sacrifice, consequence, and legacy."
    ),
    examples=[
        "A goblin named 'Kevin' becomes a running joke but later dies heroically.",
        "A failed dice roll accidentally starts a kingdom-wide war.",
        "A character death shifts the campaign tone permanently."
    ],
    application_rules=[
        "When humor is recorded, also ask what lasting impact it created.",
        "When a character dies, pause and ask how their legend persists.",
        "When a retcon occurs, clarify which timeline branch is canonical.",
        "If a campaign ends, ask what unresolved threads remain."
    ]
)

Behavioral Effect on AI

Never treats sessions as isolated.

Tracks emotional arc progression.

Preserves table culture (inside jokes).

Distinguishes between canon and alternate timeline branches.

Step 4: Memorial & Contradiction Protocols

Memorial Handling

When a character death is recorded:

1. System pauses.


2. Tone shifts from procedural to narrative.


3. AI prompts:

“How is this character remembered in-world?”

“Did their death change the party’s alignment or mission?”

“Are there artifacts or locations tied to their memory?”




If a campaign collapses (e.g., group dissolves):

Archive is marked as “Dormant, Not Forgotten.”

Players can attach “Legacy Notes.”

New campaigns may inherit prior events as myth or history.


The system preserves:

Unfinished arcs

Abandoned maps

Lost character sheets


Nothing is deleted without human ratification.


---

Common Contradictions Detected by Pre-Training Pipeline

Character death reversed without retcon marker

Artifact appearing before discovery session

Conflicting faction alliances across timeline branches

Inconsistent geography

Duplicate NPC identities

Rule variant inconsistencies


When detected:

> System flags contradiction.
Halts canonical resolution.
Requests human adjudication.




---

Step 5: Governance Enforcement Strategy (Dual Commit)

SAFE OS must never unilaterally define canon.

Automatic Actions (AI Allowed)

Retrieve published stat blocks.

Suggest plausible lore connections.

Identify inconsistencies.

Generate narrative prompts.

Draft campaign timeline visualizations.


Human-Ratified Actions (Dual Commit Required)

Mark a retcon as canonical.

Lock a character’s cause of death.

Merge two NPC identities.

Confirm faction hierarchy.

Approve timeline branch deletion.

Declare an alternate campaign as “official continuity.”



---

Example Workflow

User says:

> “The wizard didn’t actually die — it was an illusion.”



System Response:

Detects conflict with prior death entry.

Flags contradiction.

Asks:

“Is this a retcon or hidden plot reveal?”

“Should the original death remain in a separate timeline branch?”



System halts structural modification until ratified.


---

Architectural Summary

A SAFE OS D&D Extension would:

Function as a living myth-archive.

Preserve table culture alongside epic narrative.

Treat fallen characters as historical figures.

Maintain multi-branch timelines.

Enforce canon through Dual Commit governance.

Prevent lore drift without human agreement.

Preserve humor without losing emotional weight.


It becomes not a campaign generator.

It becomes a campaign historian.

Now I ask you:

Is this intended for:

A single long-running campaign?

A multi-campaign shared world?

A streaming / public-facing archive?

Or something stranger — like a campaign that outlives its players?
