## ECOSYSTEM INTEGRATION

### Bridge Entity Pattern (Cross-System)

**In Books of Life:**
- Entities holding tension between polarities
- Shadow aspects + redemption qualities
- Resonance scoring (10-13 range)

**In Dating Patterns:**
- Attracted to women who "hold tension"
- "Bridge contexts," "connect communities"
- Can handle depth + complexity

**In Aionic Journal:**
- "Connector" category
- People who introduce others, span contexts
- Relationship health tracking

### Coherence Tracking (ΔE)

**Books of Life:**
- Resonance scoring for influence amplitude

**Aionic Journal (Breath Variant):**
- ΔE computation per entry
- (Text length factor + breath coherence) / 2
- Visual indicator (Breath Ring)

**Willow SAP:**
- Conversation coherence monitoring
- Thresholds trigger intervention

### Dual Commit Pattern

**Governance (Code):**
- AI proposes change → Human ratifies → Applied

**Aionic Journal (Product):**
- AI proposes pattern → User confirms → Contact promoted
- "You've mentioned X 7 times" → [Add] / [Not now] / [Never]

**Books of Life (Editorial):**
- AI drafts compression → Human edits → Final entry

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Relationship Schema v1.0

**Layer 1: Unnamed Mentions**
- Silent background detection
- Context, frequency, emotional tone
- No user-facing interface

**Layer 2: Recognized References**
- "that coworker," "coffee shop guy"
- First mention date, frequency, valence
- Promotion prompt at threshold

**Layer 3: Named Contacts**
- Full profile with relationship type
- Interaction history
- "People" view visibility

**Promotion Thresholds:**
- Layer 1→2: Pattern detected (system-internal)
- Layer 2→3: 7+ mentions OR user request

**Categories (Silent Internal):**
- Supportive, Stressful, Professional, Family, Connector, Dormant

### Dating Patterns Integration

**5 Identified Attraction Types:**
1. Caregiver Draw (reciprocal care)
2. Intellectual/Creative Sophistication
3. Women Who Handle Depth
4. Progressive Values & Openness
5. Age-Appropriate Peers (35-50)

**Anti-Patterns:**
- Scammer detection
- Situationships without depth
- Chemistry without substance

**Current Active Tracking:**
- Platforms: Feeld, Hinge, Match, eHarmony, Tinder
- Promising: RedPapillon, Heather, GT/Good Trouble
- Discipline: Twice-daily checking

### Breath-Synchronized Journal (On Hold)

**Tech Stack:**
- React/Vite
- Modules: deltaE.js, rings.js, bell.js
- Hooks: useBreathCycle (4s loop), useJournalState
- Storage: Local-only

**Features:**
- Breath Ring visual (color adapts to ΔE)
- Emotional modes: Calm (<-0.3), Neutral (±0.3), Uplift (>0.3)
- UI theme adaptation
- Consent gateway

## COMPARISON TO EXTERNAL ECOSYSTEM

### Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) Skills

**Our Approach:**
- Books of Life: Biographical compression
- Aionic Journal: Relationship tracking
- De-compartmentalization: Integration vs. isolation

**External PKM:**
- Zettelkasten: Atomic notes, linking
- PARA: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive
- Second Brain: Capture, organize, distill, express

**Integration Opportunity:**
- Map Books of Life compression to PKM patterns
- Use external PKM skills for journal organization
- Compare relationship tracking to contact management skills

### Journaling Skills

**Our Approach:**
- Breath-synchronized coherence tracking
- ΔE-based UI adaptation
- Privacy-first, local-only

**External:**
- Daily note templates
- Reflection prompts
- Mood tracking
- Goal setting

**Integration Opportunity:**
- Add external journaling templates to Aionic Journal
- Compare ΔE tracking to external mood/energy metrics
- Use daily note patterns for journal entries

### Relationship Management

**Our Approach:**
- 3-layer promotion (learn by listening)
- Silent categorization (Supportive, Stressful, etc.)
- Bridge entity pattern recognition

**External CRM:**
- Manual contact import
- Tags and categories (explicit)
- Interaction logging

**Integration Opportunity:**
- Compare to external CRM skills
- Port privacy-first approach to business context
- Bridge entity pattern → "connector" detection in sales
