## Tomorrow - Next Target

**Primary:** Wire gate.py + watcher.py + storage.py as persistent background orchestrator
- Pickup/ has 3,027 files / 3GB (Google Drive dump)
- Queue says 2 -- severely out of sync
- Watcher sees file in drop/ -> gate classifies -> storage routes -> queue clears

**Before that:** Dedup Pickup/ first
- Hash-identical duplicates (scan running)
- Empty files (scan running)
- Stub SQLite DBs (schema only, zero rows, handed around 18 times)

## Architecture Vision

  drop/ -> watcher.py (polling) -> gate.py (classify) -> storage.py (route)
                                         |
                         willow_knowledge.db (indexed)
                                         |
                         RAG available next session

The recursive loop:
  error -> pattern (context_store) -> proposal (GNS) -> ratification -> fix -> repeat

13 = delta moment: system goes from lookup to generative/broadcasting
