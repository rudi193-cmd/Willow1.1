# Willow Intake Spec

## What Willow Is

A place to dump your heart out. It'll make some goddamn sense of everything... eventually.

## The Contract

1. **You dump.** Raw. Messy. Fragmented. Screenshots, voice notes, half-thoughts, 3am realizations, photos of whiteboards, links you'll forget why you saved.

2. **Willow holds.** Nothing judged. Nothing lost. Everything timestamped.

3. **Willow processes.** When it can. Not instantly. Eventually. Patterns emerge. Connections surface. Things route to where they belong.

4. **Willow deletes.** After processing. After routing. The staging area clears. Your permanent homes (repos, journals, projects) hold what matters. Willow doesn't hoard.

## What Willow Is Not

- Not permanent storage
- Not organized intake (that's your job later, or the system's job eventually)
- Not instant processing
- Not a second brain (it's the inbox before the brain)

## The Flow

```
You (messy) → Willow (holds) → Processing (patterns) → Routing (homes) → Delete (clear)
```

## Trust

The system handles the mess so you don't have to structure your thoughts in the moment. Structure comes later. Or never, if it wasn't worth structuring.

Dump first. Sense later.
